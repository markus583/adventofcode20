# Advent of Code 2020 with Python
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is held annually and provides two programming challenges to solve every day in December until Christmas.

I do all my solutions the day they are posted. There are no excuses to be made!
I try not to use fancy packages (for example, no PyTorch Convolutional Kernel for Challenge 11) to really get familiar with native Python and the most common packages like NumPy.
