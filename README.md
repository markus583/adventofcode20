# Advent of Code 2020 with Python
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is held annually and provides two programming challenges to solve every day in December until Christmas.

I try to do all my solutions the day they are posted and not to use fancy packages (for example, no PyTorch Convolutional Kernel for Challenge 11) to really get familiar with native Python and the most common packages like NumPy.
